          “Achebe, If you had been a lackluster storyteller in your last life, I would have asked you to borrow the tongue of a griot when you come again. But you told wonderful stories.
  
  If you had been a traitor to your people, race, nation, I would have asked you to come again with their love flowing in your veins. But you were a patriot. If you had pounded your cultural foo-foo and eaten it alone while your fellow men wallowed in heritage hunger, I would have asked you to come back with selflessness. But you were a cultural philanthropist, So I shall ask you to come again the way you came before. Achebe! Come again, the world awaits your return.”
